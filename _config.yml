summary: 'Since my PhD I have devoted my research efforts to provide solutions that (1) tackle practical
problems (writing safe distributed programs in mainstream languages) and (2) are grounded on a solid theoretical
foundation (a type theory for concurrent processes, called session types). I have shown via industry collaborations,
research prototypes and theories how to design expressive protocol specifications (with particular interest in real-time
and fault-tolerant applications) and how to efficiently verify (and recover) programs at runtime.'
